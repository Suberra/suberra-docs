## Hosted Checkout

  <img src={Image1} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>

### Lifecycle

The basic lifecycle for the checkout experience is as follows:
1. When your customers are ready to pay, your application redirects them to the Checkout page. The Checkout page displays the essential information on what they are paying for.
2. Your customer connects their wallet with the Checkout page and enters the payment information. 
3. To complete the payment, your customer will have to sign the transactions with their wallet.
4. Suberra's bots will process the payments behind the scenes. Once the payment is received, we will fire a webhook back to your application and redirect them back to a page that you can customise.
