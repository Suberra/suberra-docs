## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are a lightweight one-way communication medium for Suberra to inform merchants of actions taken by their subscribers - such as when there is a new subscriber or when there is a lapse in payments.
They allow merchants to handle payment events without having to constantly poll an endpoint.

## Subscriber Lifecycle

### New Subscriber
Fired when a user subscribes to a plan or undos their cancellation.
