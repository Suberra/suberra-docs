## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are a lightweight one-way communication medium for Suberra to inform merchants of actions taken by their subscribers - such as when there is a new subscriber or when there is a lapse in payments.
They allow merchants to handle payment events without having to constantly poll an endpoint.

## Subscriber Lifecycle

### New Subscriber
Fired when a user subscribes to a plan or undos their cancellation.

```json
{
    "id": "8d309b28-d8c4-4684-9e80-6056d57e61b6", // UUID

        "denom": "usdc",
        "amount" : 10.00 // aka $10 USDC
    }
}
