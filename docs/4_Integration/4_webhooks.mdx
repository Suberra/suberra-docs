## What are webhooks

[Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) are a lightweight one-way communication medium for Suberra to inform merchants of actions taken by their subscribers - such as when there is a new subscriber or when there is a lapse in payments.
They allow merchants to handle payment events without having to constantly poll an endpoint.

## Using webhooks with Suberra

Merchants will need to setup an endpoint in the Merchant Dashboard, which will receive the webhook payload. The endpoint will need to be able to handle the payload and respond with a 200 status code. If the endpoint does not respond with a 200 status code, Suberra will retry the request.

## Events
