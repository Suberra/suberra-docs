## What is a Payment Link

:::note

::::


Payment Link is the fastest way for a business to start accepting payments without needing a website or a single line of code.

Create a full payment page in a few clicks and share the link with your customers and users.


<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image1} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "60%" }} />
</div>



## Accept Payments in minutes

1. Create a Link

Use Payment link to sell a product or service, start a subscription or collect a donation. 

2. Share the Link

Paste the link anywhere. It can be a social media post, an email, a text message or a QR code. The same payment link can be shared with many customers across different channels. No website is required.

3. Track and Get Paid

Use Suberra's Dashboard or email to get notified of successful payment in real-time. You can also cash out the USDC to Bank Account via Circle (available to [Circle](https://circle.com) customers only).
