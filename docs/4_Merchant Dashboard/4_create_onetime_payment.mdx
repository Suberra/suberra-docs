In this guide, you will learn to create your own one-time product payment link. One-time product differs from subscriptions as it does not repeat every month.

This is useful for things like online merchandises, event tickets, one-time payment for things like invoices or software licenses (non-subscriptions based). This is not a single-use payment link. You can paste this link on your website or social media to accept payment.

1. Select Payment Links on the left menu, and click on the + button to create a new product payment link.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image1} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>

2. To create a payment link for your product, select "product" for your payment link type.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image2} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>

3. Enter your product details:

- Upload your logo or product image. Ensure the image is square, with file size limit up to 10mb allowed.
- Enter your product name and description. Remember to be as descriptive as possible!
- Key in the unit price of your product.
- Click on "Create Product", and a checkout link will be generated for you!

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image3} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>

You can further customize the checkout experience by selecting the advanced controls to control the success message and redirect URL upon successful payment.
