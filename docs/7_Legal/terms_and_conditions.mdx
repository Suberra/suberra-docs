## 4. RISKS OF USING DIGITAL ASSETS

4.1. Please note that all transactions involving Digital Assets involve certain risks. In this regard, once submitted to an Accessible Blockchain Network, such a transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Accessible Blockchain Network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Any Digital Assets transfers, to and from external wallet addresses, that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and the relevant Digital Asset will not be included in your Third Party Digital Asset Wallet or be available to conduct transactions.
4.2. The risk of loss in holding Digital Assets can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether holding Digital Assets is suitable for you in light of your financial situation. In considering whether to hold Digital Assets, you should be aware that the price or value of Digital Assets can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. Past performance is not an indicator of future performance.
4.3. If you use any Services which allow you and/or third parties to access and hold Digital Asset private keys, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for safeguarding such keys and that we are not responsible for any loss of Digital Assets resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of Digital Asset private keys outside our control.
4.4. We are not responsible for the market of Digital Assets, and we make no representations or warranties concerning the real or perceived value of Digital Assets as denominated in any quoted currency. Although we may provide historical and/or real-time data regarding the price of Digital Assets, such data is for reference only. We make no representations regarding the quality, suitability, veracity, usefulness, accuracy, or completeness of such data. You understand and acknowledge that the value of Digital Assets can be volatile, and you agree that we are not in any way responsible or liable for any losses you may incur by holding or trading Digital Assets, even if the Services were delayed, suspended, or interrupted for any reason.
4.5. We do not provide investment advice and any content on the Site should not be considered as a substitute for tailored investment advice. The contents of the Site should not be used as a basis for making investment decisions and should not be construed as an attempt to market or promote any type of Digital Asset.

7.3. Suberra has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party. We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party using Digital Assets transferred from your Third Party Digital Asset Wallet, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party.
