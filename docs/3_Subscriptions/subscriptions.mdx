## Subscription Lifecycle

### Subscribe

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image2} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>

### Renewal

Subscription renewals are handled automatically by Suberra. Suberra currently uses Gelato to automate on-chain recurring subscriptions. Here's what happens during renewal.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Image3} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</div>

1. When the product is due for renewal, we attempt a charge on the time that the product expire.
2. If the charge is successful, the product is renewed for another period. The customer's product subscription is extended for another billing cycle and service continues as usual without interruption.

If the charge is unsuccessful,

1. If the product has grace period, customer's subscription will fall within the grace period. Most businesses will continue to give users access to the product while sending reminders to the customer to ensure that their account is funded before the next payment retry.
2. If the product does not have grace period, the product will be suspended. The customer will not be able to access the product. Once cancelled, customer would have to resubscribe to get access to the product again.

### Grace Period

Grace Period can be set by the business. By default, we configure a 7 days grace period for each monthly product subscription. During these 7 days grace period, customers can still access to the product while Suberra attempts to retry the charges.
Suberra's smart payment retries first check if the user has sufficient token balance on-chain before attempting a charge. We attempt the charges frequently over the grace period.

During each charge failure attempt, Suberra can execute custom actions such as sending emails to customer to remind them to ensure that their account is funded if they wish to access the product. Suberra can also send out custom webhooks to the business for them to follow-up by themselves.
