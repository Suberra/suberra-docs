Suberra represents the access passes and membership for the subscriptions through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) called Proof-of-Membership. This Proof-of-Membership has similar interfaces as the standard NFT (ERC721) contracts, and contains the following characteristics:

## Time Expiry

The proof-of-membership will only be valid for a period of time (e.g. 30 days), and can be extended if some actions are performed (e.g. renew subscriptions). Rules can be written depending on the validity of the NFT, such as giving access to a content only if the user has a valid subscription.

## Transfer restrictions

Creators can restrict the NFT to make it non-transferable and non-tradable in marketplaces.

## Powerful integrations

Subscription NFT is backward-compatible with tools that supports ERC-721 standards. This means you can use existing tools such as portfolio managers (Nansen, Zapper), Marketplaces (Opensea) and displays natively on wallets.
You can also created gated content for Discord, Telegram and Notion via tools such as collab.land.
