Before you can start to create your payment links, you will have to set up a receiving address. This will be your collection account for all customer payments. 

You will be able to manage which blockchains you want to receive in. Suberra currently supports Polygon, Arbitrum and Avalanche with additional support for Ethereum coming soon.

1. Key in your receiver address in each blockchain's field. You can also select the option to use the same address for all chains.


:::tip

If you are using a multi-sig address or smart contract wallet, you may have a different address on different networks. Please make sure the address you have entered is correct.
