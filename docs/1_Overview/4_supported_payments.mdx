:::tip

We are rolling out on EVM chains on a rolling basis based on customer demands. If you are interested in a specific network or token that is not supported at the moment, please contact us at hello@suberra.com.
:::

## Supported Networks 

We are currently undergoing private beta trials, and will be available on the following networks in December 2022:
* Polygon
* Avalanche
* Arbitrum

We will be adding support for the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Optimism in Q1 2023.

## Supported Tokens

Suberra is designed to support any ERC20 tokens, but we will be launching with only USDC support initially. By paying with USDC, Suberra will cover the cost on behalf of users.

We will be adding support for the XSGD, WETH, WBTC, USDT, BUSD and DAI in Q1 2023.

However, due to technical limitations on the base token level, some of the tokens will not have gasless transactions.

## Supported Wallets

### Customers 
Your customers can make payment with over 100+ wallets on our hosted checkout page (Powered by [dynamic.xyz](dynamic.xyz)).

### Merchants

As Suberra is non-custodial, we do not store your funds on our accounts or smart contracts. You can use any wallet of your choice to accept incoming transactions as long as there is a persistent valid address.

We recommend using a secure wallet such Ledger, Trezor, [Multisig Wallet (Safe)](safe.global), [Coinbase Custody](https://www.coinbase.com/prime/custody) or [Fireblocks](fireblocks.com).

You may also use an address from a cryptocurrency exchange, but please check with the exchange separately on whether the address is permanent and uniquely tied to your account. 

Suberra does not make any warranty or representation on your choice of wallet, and hence will not be liable for any loss of funds.
