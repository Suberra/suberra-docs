## Gasless Transactions

Transactions on Suberra are gasless, and your customers do not have to pay gas fees to approve, pay or subscribe to a merchant on Suberra Network.

Gasless transactions (meta transactions) are transactions in which the gas cost is abstracted and paid by Suberra, rather than by the customer. Gasless transactions help to provide a smoother experience for customers and enable them to make payments easier without having to bridge or set aside gas tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc) manually.

Gasless transactions will be available for $USDC on Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum network initially. Not all tokens will have gasless transactions. Gasless transactions rely on the ERC20 permit extensions (defined in EIP-2612), it is only available on ERC20 tokens that support the standard.

## Automatic Payments for Subscriptions

Suberra handles the automatic deduction and retries of subscription payments. Our automation engine charges customers on-time, every time, and automatically retries failed payments. We also handle the automatic cancellation of subscriptions when a customer's payment method fails. 

## Wallet Compliance (Coming Soon)

Suberra's hosted checkout page automatically block risky wallets by screening wallet against ![Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/)' US OFAC sanction list. This is to ensure that your business is not exposed to any risk of being associated with sanctioned entities. This feature is enabled by default, but can be switched off anytime.
